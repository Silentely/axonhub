Let's see, it's pretty clear. I need to arrange them in rows of five numbers each.  So my thought process is literally:\n\n*   First line: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n*   Second line: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n*   Third line: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\n*   Final line: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n\nI could just use spaces between them to keep it clean and readable. That should be an efficient and clear way to deliver the result.\n"
